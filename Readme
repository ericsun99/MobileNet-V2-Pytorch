MobileNet-V2-Pytorch
Introduction

This is a Pytorch implementation of Google's MobileNet-V2. For details, please read the following papers:

Pretrained Models on ImageNet

We provide pretrained MobileNet-V2 models on ImageNet, which achieve slightly better accuracy rates than the original ones reported in the paper.

The top-1/5 accuracy rates by using single center crop (crop size: 224x224, image size: 256xN):
Network 	Top-1 	Top-5	Top-1(reported in the paper)
MobileNet v2 	71.806 	90.410	71.70


Evaluate Models
python eval.py -a mobilenetv2 --evaluate ./mobilenetv2_Top1_71.806_Top2_90.410.pth.tar ./ILSVRC2012/
